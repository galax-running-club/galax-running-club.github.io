					<h1>Beginning Runner Guide</h1>
					<h2 class="text-muted">By Andrew Peddy</h2>

					<h2>Shoes</h2>
					<p>
						The first thing I would suggest for someone who wants to get into running is a good pair
						of running shoes. Without the right type of shoe, people may increase the risk of running
						injuries, whether it is injures to the feet, ankles, or knees. Something else to keep in mind
						is that most good running shoes need to be replaced between 300-400 miles of running.
						Around this time, I can feel the support fading, and start to get more aches and pains.
					</p>
					<p>
						I always suggest going to a running store that specializes in finding the right shoe for you.
						I also suggest not to have a brand in mind but to pick the brand that feels best on your
						feet. The shoe one runner prefers or the brand one person prefers might not fit best for
						another runner.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have listed three nearby stores below that I know will look at arch and the way you
						step when you run to make suggestions for you. They will typically bring out the right
						shoe from each brand for you to try. It is also helpful to bring an old pair of running shoes
						so they can look at the pattern on the soles to see where your foot lands when you run.
						Once I find a shoe that works well for me I will stick with that same shoe when I replace
						my previous pair. I prefer RunAbout Sports but there are also Fleet Feet stores in the area
						that are well respected stores.
					</p>

					</p>

					<h2>Picking Up the Pace</h2>

					<p>
						The second thing I think is important for runners is not increasing their mileage too
						quickly or changing their pace too quickly. There is a rule that even very experienced
						runners stick to, which is the 10% rule. It is suggested to only increase weekly mileage by
						10%. So if you run 10 miles one week, run 11 miles the next week. If you run 30 miles
						one week, run 33 miles the next week. It can cause injuries to increase mileage too
						quickly, such as going from 15 miles a week to 30 miles a week, or 6 miles a week to 15
						miles a week.
					</p>
					<p>
						For beginning runners, it is important to note that the first month of
						running is when you’re most vulnerable for injures. During the first month there is an
						increase of stress on the bones, and the bones begin to weaken. This is the time when
						stress fractures and shin splints are more likely to occur. After a month the bones begin to
						strengthen and the risk of these injuries reduces.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another good way to reduce the risk of
						running injuries is consistency with running schedule. I once read that even three days
						without running reduces endurance. I would also suggest to listening to your body if you
						feel like you have an injury and cutting back/resting when needed. Muscle soreness can
						be expected but injuries need to be treated cautiously.
					</p>

					<h3>Couch to 5K</h3>
					<p>
						There is a program called the Couch to 5K program which is supposed to help runners
						begin slowly and prevent injury.
					</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Running Form</h3>
					<p>
						Running form is another thing to note that can help prevent injury. Good posture, a strong
						core, and stable shoulders can help with running. Below is an educational video about
						running form.
					</p>

					<h3>Stretches</h3>

					<p>
						The last information I want to provide is that most runners use dynamic stretches before
						their run and static stretches after the run. Dynamic stretches are meant to warm up the
						muscle and include movement.
